# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of Project

In this project, we practiced various steps of unsupervised machine learning to analyze a set of cryptocurrency data from [CryptoCompare](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/all/coinlist) and prepare a list of cryptocurrencies that are on the trading market along with a set of proposed grouping to be used to create various potential investment portfolios.

The `creypto_clustering.ipynb` file contains 4 deliverables comprising the analysis:
1. Data was preprocessed to cleanse and prepare for PCA
2. The data dimensions were reduced to 3 prinicpal components using PCA
3. The currencies were clustered into 4 classes using K-Means clustering.  An elbow curve was utilized to select 4 clusters.
4. A 3-D scatter, table and 2-D scatter plot were developed to visualize the predicted classes.
